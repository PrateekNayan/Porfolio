    "bio":"To give you a brief overview of my skill set, I have work experience of 3.7 years with Neudesic as a Consultant. During this tenure, I have worked in multiple roles - Mobile application developer, Pseudo Product owner, Automation Quality Analyst and Manual Quality Analyst. Having hands on experience in entire Software Development Lifecycle, from development to delivery of products; eventually sparked my interest in product management. Along with my technical skills, I realized it was time to broaden my knowledge base in the product management field. So, I decided to come to the Land of the free and Home of the brave to accomplish my passion!",

Some of the good quality about him are: He is confident; Willing to take things head-on; Committed; Hard working and Honest.I have worked with him on couple of instances and what was most liked by me is, you don't need to follow up with him. He will own the things and keep you posted. Also if he has to learn something, he will find his ways out, he might come to you but mostly to validate if he is on the right path. All in all, i would say he is a good responsible consultant that I had opportunity to work with. Best of Luck to Prateek! ",

He was able to demonstrate that he can learn on his own and deliver as well. He is a good thinker and knows how to think in a given situation. With this kind of mindset, he can turn around the situation. I wish him good luck with everything he does in future",
